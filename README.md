ðŸš€ Power BI Data Analysis Project: Strategic Insights for a Hotel Chain ðŸ“Š

At the end of the "Power BI Data Analysis" module, I created a comprehensive dashboard using data from a hotel chain.

ðŸ“‹ Dashboard Overview:
- **Hotel Performance**: Metrics including potential revenue (including canceled reservations), total revenue (excluding canceled reservations), revenue per customer, and average daily rate, reflecting the overall performance by hotel type.

- **Reservation Analysis**: Analysis of the number of completed and canceled reservations, the top 10 countries with the most bookings, market segments, and room types.

- **Customer Profile Analysis**: Calculation of the total number of customers, adult and child customer numbers, the top 10 countries with the most customers, and the loyalty customer ratio.

ðŸŽ¯ The data and insights gained from this project can help the hotel chain make strategic decisions on which market segments and customer types to focus on to increase profitability. This project provided an opportunity to apply my knowledge of data analytics and my proficiency in Power BI.
